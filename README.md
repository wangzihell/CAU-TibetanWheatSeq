# The Tibetan wheat sequencing project 
## Performed by Wheat Genetics and Genomics Center (WGGC) at China Argiculture University (CAU)

This repo contains customized codes used in Tibetan wheat sequencing project. Codes are grouped into multiple folders according to their usage. Appropriate comments and user manuals have been added within these scripts. A README file is provided including the descriptions of each folder.
